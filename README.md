The following R codes can be used to obtain the simulation results in the paper. 

run_Model1.R: run the simulation setting "Model 1" for one replication.

run_Model2.R: run the simulation setting "Model 2" for one replication.

run_Model3.R: run the simulation setting "Model 3" for one replication.

The results returned by these R codes include the AUC estimate and Beta estimate for each method.
